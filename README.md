# Diploma Verification On The Blockchain

*Note: This project is currently under development. The codebase is being set up, and more updates will follow soon.*

## Overview

The Diploma Verification System is a secure platform that leverages blockchain technology to authenticate university and high school diplomas. By issuing diplomas as non-transferable NFTs (Soulbound Tokens) on the Ethereum blockchain, we ensure the authenticity and integrity of academic credentials.

## Features

- **University Onboarding**: Secure registration and verification process to onboard universities onto the platform.
- **Student Verification**: Authentication system linked with university credentials to verify student identities.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Issuance of diplomas as Soulbound Tokens, preventing transferability and ensuring authenticity.
- **Secure Payment Processing**: Implementation of PCI DSS-compliant payment systems for processing student transactions.
- **User Interface**: A secure and user-friendly web application for both universities and students to interact with the system.

## Project Status

This project is a work in progress:

- The project structure is being established.
- Initial configurations and security setups are underway.
- Core functionalities are in the planning and early development stages.

Please stay tuned for updates. The repository will be updated regularly as development progresses.

## Getting Started

Instructions on how to set up the project locally will be provided once the initial development phase is completed.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum network using Solidity smart contracts
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Payment Gateway**: Stripe or PayPal (to be decided)
- **Storage**: IPFS for off-chain data storage

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome once the project reaches a stable state. Guidelines for contributing will be added soon.
